Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is basically defined as the application of scientific knowledge, skills experience and principles to resolve problems and optimize  by creating, testing and implementing software.  In other words, it is the application of scientific methods to come up with or generate a software for a particular purpose.

A well developed software is reliable and qualitative. A fit for purpose software provide efficiency and enhances industrial development process through automation, improved productivity, cost effectiveness, timeliness, better management practices. The advent of software engineering has also brought about scalability which in turn, enables faster time-to-market, increases reliability, improves user experience, innovation, brings about business growth through competitive advantage and reduced cost. it also enhances collaboration amongst stakeholders in the industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Notably, software engineering gained fame during the period of the initial space exploration in the 50s and 60s then  structured programming and modular design became a centeral focus in the 70s. Software development tools were later developed in the 80s with the introduction of the object orientated 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:
1. Documentation of Development Process 
2. Determining phase entry and exit criteria
3. Feasibility study
4. Requirements analysis and specification
5. Design 
6. Coding and unit testing (implementation)
7. Integration and system testing (testing)
8. Maintenance
9. Phase containment of errors
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
