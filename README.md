#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is basically defined as the application of scientific knowledge, skills experience and principles to resolve problems and optimize  by creating, testing and implementing software.  In other words, it is the application of scientific methods to come up with or generate a software for a particular purpose.

A well developed software is reliable and qualitative. A fit for purpose software provide efficiency and enhances industrial development process through automation, improved productivity, cost effectiveness, timeliness, better management practices. The advent of software engineering has also brought about scalability which in turn, enables faster time-to-market, increases reliability, improves user experience, innovation, brings about business growth through competitive advantage and reduced cost. it also enhances collaboration amongst stakeholders in the industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Notably, software engineering gained fame during the period of the initial space exploration in the 50s and 60s then  structured programming and modular design became a centeral focus in the 70s. Software development tools were later developed in the 80s with the introduction of the object orientated 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:
1. Documentation of Development Process 
2. Determining phase entry and exit criteria
3. Feasibility study
4. Requirements analysis and specification
5. Design 
6. Coding and unit testing (implementation)
7. Integration and system testing (testing)
8. Maintenance
9. Phase containment of errors

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION

Software development process describes the life cycle activities
more precisely and elaborately in its life cycle. It also describe various activities, prescribe a specific methodologies to carry out
the activities, and also recommends the the specific documents and other
artifacts that should be produced at the end of each phase.

It is crucial for an organization to have well documented software 
development process. Lack of proper and adequate documentation right from the ideation stage can create
several problems during development. Problems that may crop up when a development process is
not adequately documented include:
- Because documented process model ensures that every activity in the life
cycle is accurately defined and wherever necessary the
methodologies for carrying out the respective activities are described. Therefore, lack of
documentation portends loosely defined, disorderly activities thus leading to confusion and misinterpretation.
- It shows ineptitude, lack of commitment and ethics.
- time and resource wages by reinventing the wheel. Duplicating a pre-existing solution.
- difficulty in software maintenance and update. 

DETERMINING ENTRY AND EXIT PHASE
The phase entry (or exit) criteria is usually expressed as a set of
conditions that needs to be satisfied for a phase to start (or to
complete). If the entry or exit phase criteria are not clearly stated or defined then void for ambiguity will be created that could lead to confusion. Therefore set conditions for entry and exit of each phase are stated at this point.

FEASIBILITY STUDY
Feasibility study is needed to determine the economic and technical viability of the project. It involves carrying out several activities such as
collection of basic information relating to the software  for example data items that would be input to the system, the processing
required to be carried out on these data, the output data required to be
produced by the system, as well as various constraints on the
development.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS AND SPECIFICATION
This phase aims at garnering all the needs and requirements of a client and document it properly as software requirement and specification document. It involves requirements gathering and analysis as well as specification.

DESIGN
In this phase, the software requirement and specification document is transformed into a structure suitable for implementation and is made ready for coding.

CODING AND UNIT TESTING
During this phase, software design is translated into codes on the computer as source code for execution and ensure its working according to design. This phase is sometimes referred to as the implementation phase.

INTEGRATION AND SYSTEM TESTING
At this stage, various modules
making up a software are integrated in one shot. Usually, integration of various modules are normally carried out
incrementally over a number of steps. During each integration step,
previously planned modules are added to the partially integrated system and
the resultant system is tested. Finally, after all the modules have been
successfully integrated and tested, the full working system is obtained.
System testing is carried out on this fully working system.

MAINTENANCE
This include corrective maintenance carried out to correct errors not discovered during the development phase, perfective maintenance to improve performance or enhance funtionality based on clients requirements.
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach in the execution of each phase. It is predictive as each phase is executed according plan, controlled and tends avoid any deviation.
Its phases are requirements and specification, Design, implementation, Testing, Deployment and maintenance
It is rigidly structured and so much focuses on documentation.

while 

Agile methodology is iterative i.e progressively  incremental with improvements, refinement and advancement at each stage. Its phases are sprint planning, development, review and retrospect. 
It harps on collaboration, customer involvement and rapid delivery.

Comparison:

Criterion                                   Waterfall vs. Agile
1. Approach: Linear|     Iterative  2. Flexibility:Low |    High
3.  involvement:Limited| Continuous
4. Documentation:crucial| Minimal
5. Riskmanagement:Predictv|Adaptive
6. Time-to-market:Longer|  shorter

 Application scenario for: 
A.  waterfall methodology
whereby;
* a well defined and stable requirements. 
* strict documentation as per regulations.
* scope and small scope
are needed.

B.  Agile methodology
whereby;
* specification & requirements are dynamic
* customer involvement is crucial
*  rapid delivery and iteration
are needed
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

In a software engineering team, the roles of a Software Developer, Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer, and Project Manager (PM) are distinct but interconnected, each playing a crucial part in delivering successful software projects.

Each of these roles complements the others in delivering a high-quality software product within the defined constraints of time, cost, and scope.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are crucial tools in modern software development, streamlining workflows and ensuring code quality and collaboration.

Importance of IDEs:

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software suite that provides comprehensive tools for developers to write, test, and debug code. It integrates various tools into a single user interface to simplify and speed up the development process. IDEs typically include a source code editor, automation tools, a debugger, and sometimes an interpreter or compiler.

Key Benefits:

1. Efficiency: IDEs provide code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection, which make coding faster and reduce errors.


2. Debugging: Built-in debuggers help developers identify and fix issues quickly by setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and viewing variables in real-time.

3. Version Integration: Many IDEs support direct integration with Version Control Systems (VCS) such as Git, making it easy to manage code changes.

4. Language Support: IDEs often support multiple programming languages, allowing developers to work on different types of projects within the same environment.
   
Examples of IDEs:

Visual Studio Code: A lightweight, open-source IDE from Microsoft that supports multiple programming languages and extensions.

IntelliJ IDEA: A robust IDE, particularly popular for Java development, with smart code navigation and deep integration with build tools.

PyCharm: A dedicated IDE for Python, offering advanced features like code analysis and web development support.

Importance of VCS:

A Version Control System (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to code over time. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project without overwriting each other's work and helps in managing and maintaining the history of changes.

Key Benefits:

1. Collaboration: In team environments, VCS allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously by creating branches and merging them without conflicts.

2. History Tracking: VCS maintains a complete history of all code changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if necessary.

3. Backup: Code is stored in a central repository, ensuring there is always a backup in case of local failures.

4. Code Review and Quality Control: With VCS, developers can perform code reviews by comparing changes before merging them into the main branch, improving code quality.

Examples of VCS:

Git: The most widely used distributed version control system, popular for its branching and merging capabilities. It is often paired with services like GitHub or GitLab for remote repository hosting.

Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system, often used in large enterprises, where all changes are stored on a central server.

Mercurial: Another distributed VCS similar to Git, though it emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software engineers face a variety of challenges throughout their careers. Here are some common ones, along with strategies to overcome them:

1. Dynamic technological environment

Challenge: The software industry evolves quickly, with new languages, frameworks, and tools constantly emerging. This can make it hard to stay current.

Strategy:

Dedicate time each week to learning new tools or technologies (e.g., through blogs, online courses, or tutorials).

Join tech communities, attend conferences, and participate in webinars to stay updated.

Practice continuous learning by building small projects using new tools and languages.

2. Rigid and Complex Codebases

Challenge: As software projects grow, their complexity increases, making it difficult to maintain or add new features.

Strategy:

Follow best practices in code organization, such as modular design, separation of concerns, and using design patterns.

Regularly refactor code to improve its structure without changing its functionality.

Adopt test-driven development (TDD) and automate testing to catch issues early.

Use version control and collaborative tools like Git to manage changes effectively.

3. Debugging and Fixing Bugs

Challenge: Debugging can be time-consuming and frustrating, especially when tracking down intermittent or obscure issues.

Strategy:

Use debugging tools like breakpoints, logging, and stack traces to systematically track the source of issues.

Write unit tests to ensure that individual components function correctly.

Collaborate with peers during code reviews or pair programming to catch issues earlier.

4. Optimizing Speed and Quality

Challenge: There is often pressure to deliver software quickly, which can lead to shortcuts and technical debt.

Strategy:

Prioritize writing clean, maintainable code, even if it takes longer in the short term.

Regularly communicate with stakeholders about timelines and set realistic expectations for project delivery.

Use Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) to break projects into manageable iterations, allowing for continuous delivery of high-quality code.

5. Team work 

Challenge: Software engineering is often a team effort, and poor communication can lead to misunderstandings or delays.

Strategy:

Participate actively in code reviews and ensure that feedback is constructive.

Use collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, JIRA, Trello) to keep everyone on the same page.

Develop soft skills such as empathy and active listening to improve communication with team members.

6. Timeframe for Tasks and Projects

Challenge: Providing accurate time estimates is difficult, leading to missed deadlines or rushed work.

Strategy:

Break down tasks into smaller, more manageable units and estimate each one individually.

Factor in time for potential setbacks (e.g., unexpected bugs) and build a buffer into your estimates.

Use past project experiences to refine your ability to estimate time.

7. Daunting Legacy Code

Challenge: Maintaining or upgrading legacy code can be difficult, especially if it is poorly documented or outdated.

Strategy:

Document your changes thoroughly to make the code easier to work with in the future.

Refactor parts of the legacy code incrementally to improve its structure.

Write tests around legacy systems to ensure that changes don’t break existing functionality.

Strategy:

Regularly reflect on and celebrate your achievements, no matter how small.

Seek mentorship and guidance from more experienced colleagues.

Participate in open-source projects or tech communities where you can contribute and receive feedback.

Software engineers can more effectively manage the challenges they face and continuously improve their skills and productivity.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

The different types of testing—unit, integration, system, and acceptance—play key roles in verifying different aspects of the software and contribute to maintaining high-quality standards. Here’s an explanation of each type of testing and its importance:

1. Unit Testing
This is the testing of individual components or functions of the software in isolation. A "unit" can be a function, method, or class in a programming language.
This ensures that each small part of the software works correctly. It is performed by developers.
Examples of tools used include JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), Mocha (JavaScript), and NUnit (.NET).

It has the following benefit:

i. Early Bug Detection.
ii.Ensures Code Quality and Maintainability.
iii. it prevents regression.

2. Integration Testing
Integration testing focuses on testing how different modules or components of a system work together. After unit tests verify individual units, integration tests ensure that the interactions between them function correctly.
It is to ensure that different parts of the application work well together and data flows between modules without issues. It is carried out by developer of QA officer.
JUnit with integration testing frameworks, TestNG, or Postman (for API testing) are used.

Benefits include:
i. Interface Validation.

ii. Detecting System-Level Issues.

iii.Reduces System-Level Errors.

3. System Testing
System testing is the process of testing the entire application as a whole, ensuring that the system works as expected when all components are integrated. This involves testing the software from end to end, including user interfaces, databases, network communications, and external integrations. It is to ensure that the complete system meets the specified requirements and functions properly in a production-like environment. This test is performed by a QA team or independent testers. Tools like Selenium (for web UI testing), JMeter (for load testing), or Appium (for mobile app testing) are used.

The benefits include:

i. End-to-End Verification

ii. Production-Like Conditions.

iii. Validation of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements.

4. Acceptance Testing
Acceptance testing verifies that the software meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end users. It is often conducted by the client or end users to validate whether the software meets their needs.

User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Ensures the system meets the end-users' expectations.

Alpha and Beta Testing: Alpha testing is done by internal staff at the developer’s site, while beta testing is performed by real users in a production-like environment. It can be manual or automated using tools like Cucumber (for behavior-driven testing).
It has the following importance:

i. Meeting Business Requirements.

ii. Client Satisfaction.

iii. Reducing Rework.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and optimizing the inputs (or prompts) given to AI models, particularly language models like GPT, Copilot, Gemini AI, Meta AI to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and helpful responses. Since AI models rely on natural language processing to interpret and respond to prompts, how questions or tasks are framed directly impacts the quality of the output.

Key Aspects of Prompt Engineering:

1. Clarity

2. Contex

3. Examples

4. Iteration

Importance of Prompt Engineering:

1. Improving Model Accuracy.

2. Efficiency

3. Customization

4. Control over Output

5. Maximizing Model Capabilities

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example of a Vague Prompt is
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt could look something like this;

"Describe the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the job market, focusing on both positive and negative effects. Include examples of industries that have been significantly affected by AI advancements."

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:

1. Clarity.
2. Specificity
3. Conciseness
