#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is basically defined as the application of scientific knowledge, skills experience and principles to resolve problems and optimize  by creating, testing and implementing software.  In other words, it is the application of scientific methods to come up with or generate a software for a particular purpose.

A well developed software is reliable and qualitative. A fit for purpose software provide efficiency and enhances industrial development process through automation, improved productivity, cost effectiveness, timeliness, better management practices. The advent of software engineering has also brought about scalability which in turn, enables faster time-to-market, increases reliability, improves user experience, innovation, brings about business growth through competitive advantage and reduced cost. it also enhances collaboration amongst stakeholders in the industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Notably, software engineering gained fame during the period of the initial space exploration in the 50s and 60s then  structured programming and modular design became a centeral focus in the 70s. Software development tools were later developed in the 80s with the introduction of the object orientated 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of Software Development Life Cycle are:
1. Documentation of Development Process 
2. Determining phase entry and exit criteria
3. Feasibility study
4. Requirements analysis and specification
5. Design 
6. Coding and unit testing (implementation)
7. Integration and system testing (testing)
8. Maintenance
9. Phase containment of errors

DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION

Software development process describes the life cycle activities
more precisely and elaborately in its life cycle. It also describe various activities, prescribe a specific methodologies to carry out
the activities, and also recommends the the specific documents and other
artifacts that should be produced at the end of each phase.

It is crucial for an organization to have well documented software 
development process. Lack of proper and adequate documentation right from the ideation stage can create
several problems during development. Problems that may crop up when a development process is
not adequately documented include:
- Because documented process model ensures that every activity in the life
cycle is accurately defined and wherever necessary the
methodologies for carrying out the respective activities are described. Therefore, lack of
documentation portends loosely defined, disorderly activities thus leading to confusion and misinterpretation.
- It shows ineptitude, lack of commitment and ethics.
- time and resource wages by reinventing the wheel. Duplicating a pre-existing solution.
- difficulty in software maintenance and update. 

DETERMINING ENTRY AND EXIT PHASE
The phase entry (or exit) criteria is usually expressed as a set of
conditions that needs to be satisfied for a phase to start (or to
complete). If the entry or exit phase criteria are not clearly stated or defined then void for ambiguity will be created that could lead to confusion. Therefore set conditions for entry and exit of each phase are stated at this point.

FEASIBILITY STUDY
Feasibility study is needed to determine the economic and technical viability of the project. It involves carrying out several activities such as
collection of basic information relating to the software  for example data items that would be input to the system, the processing
required to be carried out on these data, the output data required to be
produced by the system, as well as various constraints on the
development.

REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS AND SPECIFICATION
This phase aims at garnering all the needs and requirements of a client and document it properly as software requirement and specification document. It involves requirements gathering and analysis as well as specification.

DESIGN
In this phase, the software requirement and specification document is transformed into a structure suitable for implementation and is made ready for coding.

CODING AND UNIT TESTING
During this phase, software design is translated into codes on the computer as source code for execution and ensure its working according to design. This phase is sometimes referred to as the implementation phase.

INTEGRATION AND SYSTEM TESTING
At this stage, various modules
making up a software are integrated in one shot. Usually, integration of various modules are normally carried out
incrementally over a number of steps. During each integration step,
previously planned modules are added to the partially integrated system and
the resultant system is tested. Finally, after all the modules have been
successfully integrated and tested, the full working system is obtained.
System testing is carried out on this fully working system.

MAINTENANCE
This include corrective maintenance carried out to correct errors not discovered during the development phase, perfective maintenance to improve performance or enhance funtionality based on clients requirements.
    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

The waterfall methodology follows a linear and sequential approach in the execution of each phase. It is predictive as each phase is executed according plan, controlled and tends avoid any deviation.
Its phases are requirements and specification, Design, implementation, Testing, Deployment and maintenance
It is rigidly structured and so much focuses on documentation.

while 

Agile methodology is iterative i.e progressively  incremental with improvements, refinement and advancement at each stage. Its phases are sprint planning, development, review and retrospect. 
It harps on collaboration, customer involvement and rapid delivery.

Comparison:

Criterion                                      Waterfall vs. Agile
1. Approach: Linear|     Iterative  2. Flexibility:Low |      High
3.  involvement:Limited| Continuous
4. Documentation:crucial|   Minimal
5. Riskmanagement:Predictv|Adaptive
6. Time-to-market:Longer|  shorter Application scenario for: 
A.  waterfall methodology
whereby
* a well defined and stable requirements. 
* strict documentation as per regulations.
* scope and small scope
are needed.

B.  Agile methodology
whereby;
* specification & requirements are dynamic
* customer involvement is crucial
*  rapid delivery and iteration
are needed
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
